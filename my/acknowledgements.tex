I would like to express my utmost gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Ken Pu, for
his guidance, encouragement and support. 
I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Heidar Davoudi and
Dr. Steven Livingstone. I am grateful for their valuable feedback on this thesis.
Last but not least, I am thankful to my wife Xiao Wang and the rest of my family.
All have provided me with patience and support for the challenges I faced
in order to perform research and write this thesis.
None of this would have been possible without their support.
