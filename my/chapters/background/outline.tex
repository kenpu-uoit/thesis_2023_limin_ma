    \item Provide background material for the partial tuple search, and its solution.  We introduce mathematical notations.
    \item Relational model: table, attributes, tuples, values
    \item Document model: text fields
    \item Document search: tokenization, inverted index
    \item Fuzzy matching with ngram
    \item Existing software libraries: Lucene
    \item Neural language models and embedding vectors
